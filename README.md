# Pricing vanilla options through PDEs
**<u> Group1 </u>:** *Garriga Maxime, Soughati Kenza, Saulis Lukas, Collin Thibault*, within the scope of the M203 C++ class

The goal of this project is to build a pricer of vanilla option from the PDE of the derivatives payoff. Key implementations include matrix inversion algorithm and boundaries condition verification. Comments are written along the way, and a detailed documentation will follow soon.

*To handle matrix inversion and operations*
